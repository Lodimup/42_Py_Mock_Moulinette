## **42_Py_Mock_Moulinette**

I heard you like codes so I put C into BashScript into Python.

Inspired by MockMoulinette https://github.com/kristofk/MockMoulinette

**Why?**

 1. Because I got rekt by C00
 2. Because why do things manually when you can: Try to automate 5 min tasks and spectacularly fail after 10 hours.
 3. I’ve always wanted to learn Popen. It’s the pathway to the dark side.
 4. I skipped Shell01

**Why Python?**

“I ran out of time. ” - said this guy

**How it works:**

Py_Mock_Moulinette will “try” to KAPUT your code by compiling and running it against expected values.

Pure python standard lib.  No venv no pip shenanigans.

**Usage:**

    git clone 
    mv * <root_of_your>
    cd <root_of_your>
    python3 PMM.py

  
After you’re done to send PMM to the afterworld ( delete )

    bash goodbye_PMM.sh

Pull requests welcome
