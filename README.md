I heard you like codes so I put C into BashScript into Python.

Inspired by MockMoulinette https://github.com/kristofk/MockMoulinette

**Why?**

 1. Because I got rekt by C00
 2. Because why do things manually when you can: Try to automate 5 min tasks and spectacularly fail after 10 hours.
 3. I’ve always wanted to learn Popen. It’s the pathway to the dark side.
 4. I skipped Shell01

**Why Python?**

**How it works:**

Py_Mock_Moulinette will “try” to KAPUT your code by compiling and running it against expected values.

Pure python standard lib.  No venv no pip shenanigans.

**Usage:**

    git clone https://github.com/Lodimup/42_Py_Mock_Moulinette.git
    cp -r 42_Py_Mock_Moulinette/ <root_of_your_repo>/
    cd <root_of_your_repo>
    python3 PMM.py


After you’re done to send PMM to the afterworld ( delete )

    bash goodbye_PMM.sh

Pull requests welcome

Pro tips. Yell “MOULINETTEEEEEEEE” while testing to increase your chance of Moulinette not rekting you by exactly 0%.

**todo:**

Parse Norminette stdout  
Finish Shell01
